## Project--Recommendations-with-IBM-Udacity

The goal of the project is to analyze the **interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform**, and **make recommendations to them about new articles they will like**.


The project is organized in several steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Rank Based Recommendations: Find the most popular articles based on the number of interactions.
3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: Find similar users in terms of the items they have interacted with.
4. Matrix Factorization: Use matrix factorization to make article recommendations to the users.
